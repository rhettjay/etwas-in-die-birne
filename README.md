# Etwas-in-die-birne
The Germans have a saying "Er/Sie hat etwas in die Birne". Which loosely translated means (you have something in the pear), in other words your contemplating something.\
This repo represents my own inability to get ideas out of my head and is thus a place for those ideas to live while I work up the time to get them working.
Text file of all my goof off ideas so I can put them somewhere and not think about them until I have time. You'll notice some of these actually do get made into something, others not so much. Feel free to PR your own ideas here.

### Ideas
#### More likely to be worked on
  * Neovim/vim script to comment out the current line (already exists in astronvim check source code)
  * Testing framework thats built with ESM and doesnt support CJS (at least nkt
  not for v1
  * go api factory making use of abstract classes and gin
* Terraform module that allows for pointing your terraform directly at a .env file
* Testing artifactory that will allow for generating a test suite from a .yml file or swagger.json file
    <details> Utilize typebox or fastify-type-provider-typebox to call endpoints recursively. Still bouncing this one around on how it could be done, but I'm convinced it can and should be written </details>
* [ts-tokeman](https://github.com/jay-bulk/ts-tokeman) 
* test out spacevim OR astrovim as a replacement for webstorm can you be just as productive (if not more so in a vim-like editor) Notes: Astrovim is the most promising thus far. See my .config folder or my astro vim setup
* repo with examples of good and bad architecture including what is encapsulation, etc

#### Less likely to be worked on
  * A weight scale to measure the syrup levels of the coke machine one the 2nd floor lobby
  * A monitor to alert when levels are low
    <details>Will need acccess to wifi, a scale, an arduino a button, a bread board</details>
  * Website: https://how2electronics.com/iot-weighing-scale-hx711-load-cell-esp8266/
  * Persist data of the syrup so I can build an api on top of the data to know before I leave my seat if the machine is currently stocked on the beverage I want
