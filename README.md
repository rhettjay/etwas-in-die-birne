Text file of all my goof off ideas so I can put them somewhere and not think about them until I have time

### Ideas
## Terraform module that allows for pointing your terraform directly at a .env file ##
- A weight scale to measure the syrup levels of the coke machine one the 2nd floor lobby
-- A monitor to alert when levels are low
-- Will need acccess to wifi, a scale, an arduino a button, a bread board
-- Website: https://how2electronics.com/iot-weighing-scale-hx711-load-cell-esp8266/
- Persist data of the syrup so I can build an api on top of the data to know before I leave my seat if the machine is currently stocked on the beverage I want
